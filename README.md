# EDA-Feature-Engineering-on-Housing-Dataset
In this project, I perform an EDA and Feature Engineering on the Housing price dataset from Kaggle. And looking forward to developing a model using it.

### This Project Contains...
	Library Used :-
		Pandas
		Numpy
		Matplotlib
		sklearn
		
		
## How I approach this Problem Statement :-
First of all i get the overall idea of the dataset using info() and Shape.
Than i Seperate the categorical and numerical features to deal with them seperately.

We have to deal with categorical and numerical features separately because after EDA and Feature Engineering we have to feed this data to the ML model which doesn't work on categorical values. So we must separate both of them.

## Rest of the approach/information is mentioned in Jupyter Notebook.
